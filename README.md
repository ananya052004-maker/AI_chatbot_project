🚀 How It Works
The user types a question or topic.

The bot formats it into a research-oriented prompt.

It sends the prompt to OpenAI's API.

The response is displayed in the terminal with detailed and structured information.

This project is ideal for those who want a command-line tool that behaves like a personal research assistant, capable of explaining complex topics, summarizing concepts, or providing brief knowledge overviews on almost anything.
