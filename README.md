# AI Chatbot using Python and OpenAI API

This project is a simple yet powerful AI chatbot built using **Python** and the **OpenAI API**. It accepts user input through the terminal and responds intelligently using natural language processing capabilities powered by OpenAI's large language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).

## Features

- Conversational AI using OpenAI's GPT models
- Text-based chat interface (terminal/console)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered by OpenAI
- Easily extendable and customizable
- Minimal setup and lightweight codebase

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4)
- Basic terminal I/O

## How It Works

The chatbot takes user input as a prompt and sends it to the OpenAI API. The response from the model is then displayed to the user in a conversational manner.
